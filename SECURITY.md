# Security Measures

## Data Protection

1. **Encryption**: Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms. 
   - **Implementation**: Use HTTPS for all communications and ensure database encryption.
2. **Access Control**: Implement strict access control policies to restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles and permissions.

## Secure Transmission

1. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS for all communications between clients and servers to protect data from eavesdropping and tampering.
   - **Implementation**: Ensure the Angular application is served over HTTPS.
2. **TLS**: Ensure that Transport Layer Security (TLS) is configured correctly and kept up to date to secure data transmission.
   - **Implementation**: Configure TLS on the server hosting the Angular application.

## Secure Storage

1. **Database Security**: Use secure database configurations, including encryption at rest, strong authentication mechanisms, and regular security updates.
   - **Implementation**: Ensure the database used by the backend API is securely configured.
2. **Backup Security**: Ensure that backups are encrypted and stored securely, with access restricted to authorized personnel only.
   - **Implementation**: Encrypt backups and store them in a secure location.
3. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate potential security risks.
   - **Implementation**: Schedule regular security audits and use tools like OWASP ZAP for vulnerability assessments.

## Additional Measures

1. **Security Patches**: Regularly apply security patches and updates to all software components to protect against known vulnerabilities.
   - **Implementation**: Keep Angular, dependencies, and server software up to date.
2. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.
   - **Implementation**: Use logging services and monitoring tools to track application activity.
3. **Security Training**: Provide regular security training for all employees to ensure they are aware of best practices and potential threats.
   - **Implementation**: Conduct regular security training sessions for the development team.
